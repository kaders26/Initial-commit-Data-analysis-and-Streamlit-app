# Superstore Data Analysis & Streamlit App

This project leverages the Superstore dataset to conduct data analysis, build a machine learning model, and deploy an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Superstore dataset is explored and processed in the following steps:

1. **Initial Data Review**: Understanding the structure, data types, and missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key insights with Seaborn and Plotly.
3. **Machine Learning**: A regression model built using `RandomForestRegressor` to predict sales.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Enhancing the dataset with new features to improve model performance.

An interactive web app is created using Streamlit to visualize data and make predictions.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard – Superstore Sales Analysis

This project analyzes Superstore sales data across the United States using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models. The insights are visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## What's Included in the App?
Interactive visualizations of the Superstore dataset

Sales and profit breakdowns by region and category

A prediction form using the trained machine learning model

Clean and intuitive interface for users to explore and interact with the data

## 📈 Model Evaluation
The machine learning model used in this project is a Random Forest Regressor. Below are its performance metrics:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 62.85
On average, the model’s predictions deviate by about 62.85 units from the actual values. This is a direct and interpretable measure of error.

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 206.06
This value emphasizes larger errors due to squaring. A lower RMSE indicates better performance.

R² Score (Coefficient of Determination): 0.78
The model explains 78% of the variance in the target variable (sales), indicating a good fit.

## 📦 How to Use
Open the app to view initial data visualizations.

Scroll down to the "Prediction" section:

Fill in the required input fields

Submit the form to receive the predicted sales output

Analyze different regions and trends directly in the app
